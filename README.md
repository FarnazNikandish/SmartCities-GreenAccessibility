GIS-based analysis of green accessibility in Toronto neighbourhoods
# Green Accessibility Analysis – Toronto Smart Cities Project

This project evaluates green space accessibility across Toronto neighbourhoods using GIS techniques.
It computes Green Buffer Coverage (GBC), defined as the percentage of each neighbourhood located
within 300m, 500m, and 800m of public greenspaces.

## Objectives
- Measure spatial equity in green space distribution
- Identify underserved neighbourhoods
- Visualize accessibility patterns using geospatial analysis

## Data Sources
- Toronto Neighbourhood Boundaries (GeoJSON)
- Toronto Greenspaces (GeoJSON)

## Methods
- Geopandas spatial operations
- Buffer analysis (300m / 500m / 800m)
- Intersection area measurement
- Choropleth map visualization

## Outputs
- Accessibility index table (CSV)
- Choropleth maps

## Tools
- Python
- GeoPandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
Neighbourhoods are ranked based on accessibility levels.  
Areas with low GBC are identified as priority zones for urban planning improvements.
